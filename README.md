# Public Health Disease Surveillance Architecture Development Project
### Overview

The Public Health Disease Surveillance Architecture Development Project aimed to create a robust infrastructure for monitoring and managing disease outbreaks. This involved setting up virtual machines (VMs) on the MTU College of Computing Cluster, deploying an OpenEMR system for electronic medical records, configuring a HAPI FHIR server for data exchange, and utilizing Synthea for generating synthetic patient data for disease outbreak simulations.

### Objectives

1. **Infrastructure Setup**: Create virtual machines on the MTU College of Computing Cluster for hosting various components of the surveillance architecture.
2. **OpenEMR Installation**: Deploy OpenEMR, an open-source electronic medical records solution, on the virtual machines to manage patient data.
3. **Synthea Integration**: Utilize Synthea to generate synthetic patient data representative of different hospitals and regions for disease outbreak simulations.
4. **HAPI FHIR Server Configuration**: Set up a HAPI FHIR server to facilitate seamless data exchange and interoperability among healthcare systems.
5. **Postman Interaction**: Use Postman to interact with the HAPI FHIR server, perform CRUD operations on FHIR resources, manage authentication, and handle error responses.

### Technologies Used

- **Virtualization**: VMware for creating and managing virtual machines.
- **OpenEMR**: Open-source electronic medical records and practice management solution.
- **Synthea**: Open-source software for generating synthetic patient data.
- **HAPI FHIR**: Open-source implementation of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard.
- **Postman**: API development and testing tool for interacting with RESTful APIs.

### Challenges Faced

1. **Configuration Complexity**: Setting up the virtual machines and configuring network settings required careful attention to detail to ensure proper connectivity.
2. **Software Integration**: Integrating OpenEMR, Synthea, and HAPI FHIR posed challenges in configuring each component to work seamlessly within the architecture.
3. **API Interaction**: Understanding and utilizing Postman effectively for interacting with the HAPI FHIR server, performing CRUD operations, and managing authentication required a learning curve.

### Outcomes Achieved

1. **Successful Infrastructure Setup**: Virtual machines were created on the MTU College of Computing Cluster, providing a platform for hosting the surveillance architecture.
2. **Functional OpenEMR Deployment**: OpenEMR was deployed and configured to manage electronic medical records efficiently.
3. **Synthetic Patient Data Generation**: Synthetic patient data was generated using Synthea for simulating disease outbreaks across different hospitals and regions.
4. **HAPI FHIR Server Configuration**: A HAPI FHIR server was successfully configured to facilitate interoperability and data exchange among healthcare systems.
5. **Effective API Interaction**: Postman was used to interact with the HAPI FHIR server, enabling CRUD operations on FHIR resources, managing authentication, and handling error responses.
